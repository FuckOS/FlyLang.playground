var n='\n\nWelcome to Flylang Playground!\n\nInput in the editor on the left, and results will be shown here in real time!\n\nFlylang is an error-oriented language, with the following features:\n\n  - With no cross-platform support\n  - Able to run on shared hostings that support PHP 8.0 (This playground server is hosted on a free shared hosting)\n  - Interpreted language\n  - Extremely low performance\n  - Huge code amount\n  - Auto type-detection\n  - Error oriented\n\nGive us a star to show your support!\n\nFly50w (Flylang PHP implemention): https://github.com/FuckOS/fly50w\nFlylang Universal Standard: https://github.com/FuckOS/FlyLang-Universal-Standard\nFlylang Playground API: https://play-f5w-01.flyos.top/api/play/\n\nA hello world example:\n\n\t!import playground/println.f5w\n\tlet main = fn () {\n  \t\tprintln("Hello, World");\n\t};\n\tmain();\n\nAn arithmetic example:\n\n\tlet simpleMath = fn (numX, numY) {\n\t\tlet numY = numX ** numY - 1;\n\t\treturn (numY + 3) / 2.0;\n\t};\n\tprint(simpleMath(123, 3));\n\n\nYou can use print("xxx"); to output strings.\nWhen "playground/println.f5w" is imported, then you can use println.\n';export{n as default};
